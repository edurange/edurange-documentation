##Scapy Hunt

### Description

Scapy Hunt poses the challenge of analyzing network traffic to
understand who is communicating with whom and how. The player is trying
to get data from an ftp server which is not on the same subnet, but one
of the hosts on its network is communicating with it. By default the
player can only see packets sent to the server and must craft packets to
get them routed to the target and get a response back.
