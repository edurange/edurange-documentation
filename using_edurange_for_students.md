# Using EDURange

Your instructor will give you an access code that you can use to
register for EDURange. You will register at http://cloud.edurange.org.
When your instructor creates an exercise and places you in a group, it
will be accessible to you in the scenarios section of your EDURange home
page. From there you will be able to see your login credentials as well
as your initial instructions. You can use that to connect via ssh to the
public IP address of a gateway for that exercise. Some exercises will
also have questions to be answered via the EDURange scenario page.
Others have questions listed in this manual that your instructor might
have separate instructions for.
