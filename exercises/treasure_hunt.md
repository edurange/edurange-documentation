## Treasure Hunt

### Description

Treasure Hunt is an exercise that teaches about permissions and other
security loopholes in Linux. In this virtual machine there are 16
imaginary users. Somewhere in his/her home directory, each of these
imaginary users has a "secret" file named `username-secret.<ext>`
(where `<ext>` is a file extension) whose contents are intended to
be private (readable only by the user and no one else). However, each of
their secret files can actually be read by other users who are both
determined and clever. Your goal is to collect the contents of as many
of the sixteen secret files as you can.

### Background

There are often multiple users on the same system or network. Given this
case, how does a system determine who is able to access specific files?
Linux system of file access permissions are used to control who is able
to read, write and execute certain files. This is used both to keep user
files private as well as to protect critical system files. In order to
obtain many of the secrets in this exercise, you will need to understand
the read, write, and execute permissions as well as how permissions are
applied to the owner, group owner, and every user. If you are unfamiliar
with linux permissions, see the section on Linux File Permissions in the
Student Tutorials section below.

This exercise also utilizes password cracking for a few users. That
password cracking method that you will work with utilizes linux password
hashes. This exercise is not intended to teach about hashes and password
security techniques. If you are unfamiliar with the general idea of
them, a quick web search should catch you up with the basics. The files
that contain the password hashes are not publicly available on linux
systems, but we have made them so for this exercise and will show where
to find them. Hopefully, this will give you an idea if the passwords you
use are secure or not!

You will also run into the .htaccess file in this exercise. This is a
configuration file for Apache Web Server. It is used for many things but
here it is only used from user authorization. You should be able to
figure it out when you come across it. If not, a simple web search will
help you out again.

### Learning Objectives

* Know the difference between read, write, and execute permissions and how this affects directories and files

* Be able to create a symbolic link and know what it does
* Recognize what sorts of passwords are easily cracked from known password hashes
* Have a moderate understanding of some basic linux tools and how to use them

### Instructions

Connect to the VM via your instructor’s directions, or as displayed on
your EDURange account.

Once logged in, it is your goal to find the secrets of the following 16
fake users:

* Alice Wan (awan)
* Bob Duomo (bduomo)
* Cathy Dry (cdry)
* Debbie Shi (dshi)
* Ellen Quintus (equintus)
* Fred Sexon (fsexon)
* George Hepta (ghepta)
* Helen Ochoa (hochoa)
* Inna Nunez (inunez)
* Jack Dekka (jdekka)
* Karen Elva (kelva)
* Loretta Douzette (ldouzette)
* Patricia Kaideka (pkaideka)
* Pyotr Theodore Radessime (pradessime)
* Quinn Sanera (qsanera)
* Tudor Daforth (tdaforth)

Each secret is contained somewhere in that user's home directory. All
fake users belong to a group named student, a fact that is important for
some of the attacks. There are other significant groups as well that
some of these users are in.

There is no strict sequential order for finding the secrets, though some
you will only be able to get after gaining access to another user's
account. Password cracking is a great place to start. We will walk you
through that below.

Accessing some secret files will require that you make changes to
certain files/directories in the accounts of the fake users. Once you
determine the secret, be sure to undo any changes that you make so that
you leave the system exactly in the same state that you found it.
Otherwise, you could (1) make it very easy for others to access the
information you worked so hard to get or (2) make it impossible for
others to access the information you found (this is unacceptable in this
exercise, though not in the real world).

Since some of your changes may be hard for you to undo, you can use the
resetFakeUsers command to resets all fake user accounts to their initial
states and also resets other parts of the system (e.g. deletes all files
in the `/tmp` directory). Executing this command should solve all reseting
issues; if it does not, please let us know. By calling resetFakeUsers
frequently, you could cause a denial of service attack against your
classmates; please do not do this!

(Note: One case has been found where resetFakeUsers does not work. This
is after finding a particular secret, so you should be able to figure
out what is necessary to make it work again.)

*Password Cracking*:

For password cracking download John the Ripper from
http://www.openwall.com/john/ onto a local computer. John the Ripper is
not on the Treasure Hunt VM, and you won't be able to install it there.
If you only have access to a Windows computer for your local machine,
John the Ripper suggests HashSuite; though we won't provide you with
instructions on how to use that program.

On the Treasure Hunt machine, gain access to the file `/etc/shadow`. (See
hints below if stuck). You will need a copy of `/etc/shadow` and
`/etc/passwd` on your machine running John the Ripper.

Use John’s unshadow command to combine `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` into
a single password file (e.g. `unshadow passwd shadow > mypasswd`).

Manually edit `mypasswd` to exclude all accounts other than the 16 fake
users for this problem – otherwise you’re wasting processing time in
your password cracker. When you find the secret of a fake user, removing
that user from the unshadowed file will help speed up future attempts.
You do not want to waste processing time trying to crack passwords you
don’t need!

Run John on `mypasswd` (e.g. 'john passwords'). The basic john command
uses the default wordlist `run/password.lst`, which should be able to
fairly quickly crack two user passwords. There is one more password that
can be cracked, but you will need to feed john a custom word list. Maybe
if you knew more about fake users...

*User Web Pages*:

Each user has at least one web page in a public html directory. Some of
these pages contain information relevant to finding their secret.
Although many of the user web pages are publicly readable by any user on
the THVM, some can only be read via a web browser. Since you are logged
in via ssh, you might be wondering how you can view these web pages.
Lynx is a text-based web browser that we have provided for your use.
Typing 'lynx localhost/\~awan/' will let you view awan's homepage. The
same format can be used to view the other 15 user's pages. Though you
can see the public html pages in each user's directory, due to the
permissions of any private files, you will need to use Lynx to uncover
some of the secrets. See Lynx's man page for specific instructions. (w3m
might also be installed, but the default version might not help you with
every secret).

*Hints*:

- It may be helpful to export certain files from the THVM to your local
computer (or vice versa). You can use scp or ftp from your local
computer to do this.

- Having trouble gaining access to /etc/shadow? Look in /bin/ and see if
you can find something to help you.

- Access to web directories can be controlled by a .htaccess file. See
http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/htaccess.shtml for documentation on
.htaccess files.

- The web server runs as user/group www-data. Including www-data in a
group gives the web server whatever permissions are given to the group.
There is a group named apache whose only member is www-data.

- In an HTML file, text between `<!--` and `>` is a comment that is
not displayed by the web browser.

- The ghostview suite is installed. The gv command can be used to
display .pdf files. (Be patient; it is very slow when displaying a
window remotely. Alternatively, you may want to export relevant .pdf
files from the THVM to your local computer and view them there.)

- It is possible to convert .pdf files to other file formats, and there
are programs in the THVM for doing this. But saying exactly what those
programs are would make one secret too easy too find. So you might want
to research how to convert .pdf files to other formats in Linux.

- .docx format is a zipped (compressed) directory of XML files; it can
be uncompressed with the unzip command. There are many ways to obtain
that secret though.

- If you want to add a directory dir to the front of your PATH variable,
a good way to do this is with the following command - `export PATH=dir
:$PATH` (e.g. `export PATH=/tmp/:\$PATH`)

- The strings command could be helpful for some secrets. As well as a
hex viewer.
